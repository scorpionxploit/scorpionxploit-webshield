## 1. Executive Summary & Audit Mandate
All repositories published under **ScorpionXploit** undergo defensive cybersecurity verification before public release. This document establishes the formal compliance baseline, secret-scanning gates, static analysis checks, input boundary validations, and supply chain integrity tests applied to `scorpionxploit-webshield`.

- **Audit Status:** [x] PASSED - DEFENSIVE BASELINE SATISFIED
- **Classification:** Defensive Cybersecurity & Open-Source Research
- **Compliance Baseline:** OWASP ASVS v4.0 / CIS Foundations / OpenSSF Scorecard

---

## 2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- [x] **Semgrep Custom Rule Verification:**
  - Automated rules scanned for insecure deserialization (`pickle.loads`, `yaml.unsafe_load`).
  - Flagged and eliminated any arbitrary code execution surfaces (`eval()`, `exec()`, unchecked subprocess calls).
  - Ensured shell calls explicitly pass argument lists rather than raw `shell=True` strings.
- [x] **Static Type & Syntax Validation:**
  - Strict type hints applied across public function signatures.
  - Zero fatal unhandled exceptions during AST parsing.
- [x] **Linters & PEP 8 Standards:**
  - Code analyzed with `flake8` / `ruff` / `mypy` for stylistic consistency and defensive edge cases.

---

## 3. Secret & Credential Leak Prevention
- [x] **Gitleaks Pre-commit & CI Audit:**
  - Repository scanned across entire commit tree for high-entropy secrets and credential tokens.
  - Verification that no hardcoded AWS Access Keys (`AKIA...`), GitHub PATs (`ghp_...`), private SSH keys (`-----BEGIN...`), or API tokens exist in any file.
- [x] **Environment Variable Isolation:**
  - All configurable API endpoints, tokens, and credentials ingested exclusively through system environment variables or `.env` (with `.env.example` provided).
  - `.gitignore` configured to prevent staging credentials, certificates, or local virtual environments (`venv/`, `.env`, `*.pem`).

---

## 4. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) & Supply Chain Integrity
- [x] **Dependency Minimization:**
  - Prioritized standard library implementations to eliminate third-party supply chain risks and dependency bloat.
- [x] **Automated Vulnerability Scanning (Trivy & Dependabot):**
  - All declared dependencies checked against CVE databases for known vulnerabilities (CVSS score ≥ 7.0 blocked).
  - Pinned exact dependency versions in `requirements.txt` / manifest files.
- [x] **SBOM Artifact Generation:**
  - Workflows configured to generate CycloneDX and SPDX SBOM JSON bundles for enterprise compliance.

---

## 5. Input Sanitization & Network Boundary Controls
- [x] **Path Traversal & File Boundary Defense:**
  - All file path arguments sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks (`../` or absolute path escapes).
- [x] **Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS) Defense:**
  - All regular expression patterns analyzed for catastrophic backtracking.
  - Timeout throttles and linear-time matching applied to log parsers and string extractors.
- [x] **Safe Defanging & Refanging Engine:**
  - Malicious URLs, IP addresses, and domain indicators rendered inert (`hxxp[://]`, `[.]`) to prevent accidental user execution or automated webhook triggers.
- [x] **Local Network Binding Safety:**
  - Network probes and listening interfaces strictly bound to `127.0.0.1` or RFC 1918 test subnets by default, with built-in safety throttles.

---

## 6. Automated Testing & Verification
- [x] **Pytest Unit Test Suite:**
  - Real unit tests executed covering standard paths, error boundaries, and synthetic edge-case payloads.
  - Minimum test pass requirement: 100% passing tests prior to release.
- [x] **CI/CD Security Automation:**
  - GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests automatically across multiple Python/runtime environments on every pull request.

---

## 7. Open-Source Hygiene & Legal Transparency
- [x] **Open-Source License:** Permissive open-source license (`MIT` or `Apache-2.0`) verified in root directory.
- [x] **Coordinated Disclosure Policy:** `SECURITY.md` present detailing reporting channels (`aditya08sharma@gmail.com`).
- [x] **Contribution Guidelines:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` established ensuring defensive research ethics for external contributors.
- [x] **Documentation Standard:** Comprehensive `README.md` containing architectural overview, quickstart commands, and reproducible testing instructions.
